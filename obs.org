** Notes
Collimation not held particularly secondary, and new long 7/32" allen
key socket fit into socket heads so tightly that pulling it out after an
adjustment moved the secondary.  Found that some of the spider screws were not
tight.  After tightening the held position better and I was able to collimate.
Replaced CR2032 battery in laser collimator even though it appeared to be
working in the morning.  The dimming after some time spent collimating (and
swearing) returned appears to be temperature (in the 30s this night).  Output
returned after warming collimator.  Next found collimation hard to adjust
i.e. not consistent results turning the bolts.  At least one bolt almost all
the way in and behavior more consistent when it was backed out.  Collimation
also changed notably with altitude, and I found the sling for the mirror had
slipped partially.  Collimation only changed slightly with altitude after
sling adjusted.  Again without fan mirror seemed poorly equilibrated with
shimmers in star images, but night was very windy as well so hard to
deconflate the two effects largely stayed with 30mm eyepiece and only used
16mm Pretoria a few times.  Observed from 2330 to 0315.  Conditions warmer
than 18th (upper 30s dropping to mid 30s but very windy.  Mass of 20" did not
have any trouble with wind.)  Wind rose later in evening preventing using the
Orion Deep Map, and netbook battery gave up a little after 0200 (check netbook
battery life).  Used printed Mag7-BW starchart (comb bound) for rest of
evening. Began with star clusters before the moon set.  Observed: M41, M93,

NGC2232, NGC2215, scanned star field around area south of the feet of Gemini
and may have looked at rosette neb. but hard to tell, When to the north then

R Leporis
** Notes
Found 5V USB powered fan again.  Used black duct tape to attach fan.
Set up telescope shortly before sunset and left with fan running to cool
mirror while finishing making red beans for dinner.  Gate latches snapped off
while taking telescope out of shop, but the screw eyes they connected to in
the handles engaged the rocker box farther up which made it workable.  Much
better images with cooled mirror. Used Sky Commander digital setting circles
after remembering that alt encoder direction is part of setup and that encoder
is on left side of 20" dob instead of right side like the 13" dob.  After
setting the correct encoder direction the Sky Commander worked fairly well
although significan azimuth errors when changing position by significant
amounts cropped up later in the evening.  Began with M42 and equilibrated
mirror noticeable looking at trapezium.  Saw fifth star.  Moved to M31, M32,
M110, M33 (good conditions meant saw spiral arms and knots of HII regions in
the arms) Noticed stuff in the area on the Deep Map 600 looked at M76 (little
Dumbell) and M74 (galaxy) which I think I have never seen before as well as
M103 and M52 in Casseiopeia plus NGC7510 (open cluster, naked eye visible) and
NGC7535 (faint nebula) then moved to M77 (compact galaxy next to faint naked
eye star in Cetus) and then after a couple of iterations looking at sky and
charts 32 Eridani and relearned why I pointed the 10 inch refractor at it at
LSU.  Beautiful yellow-blue double star.  It was actually visible to naked eye
at Hazel River Dr.  Tried to find R Leporis but was not sure I found it.
Looked at M79 with higher power than before.  Looked at M42 and M43 again,
M78, NGC 2024 and tried to look at Horsehead Nebula not sure nebulosity
visible.  Buy Nebula filter.  Looked at M1 and M45, NGC2392 (Eskimo Nebula)
and NGC2244 (Rosette large diffuse object so unimpressive) plus M67 in Cancer.
Took a couple of iterations with red dot finder and charts to find NGC3115
(Spindle Galaxy).  Observed Leo Triplet M65, M66, and NGC3628 plus NGC3607 in
Leo.  Spent roughly an hour working through the Virgo Galaxy cluster started
with the separated one M61 and M49 by pointing with charts and red dot finder.
The started at Epsilon Virginis and worked through checking relative position
with charts and kstars for orientation to verify which one I was looking at.
Looked at M59 and M60 plus companion NGC4647 then M58 plus near by NGC4564 and
NGC4567+NGC4568 (Siamese twins, but did not look closely at them should next
time) then M89 over to M87 back and on to M90 the to M84 and M86 and the
Markian chain clearly resolved NGC4435, NGC4438, NGC4388 (estimated 9-10
galaxies in field of view).  Next worked through M100 to M98 then to M99 (in
that order due to 5-7 magnitude stars leading from M100 to M98 then going back
to middle of chain of stars to drop to M99 which was almost straight down in
altitude).  M85 next by pointing red dot finder near 4.83 mag star.  Looked at
M51, M101 and M97 (Owl Nebula) plus M109 then spent 15 minutes finding M104
(Sombrero Galaxy).  At this point it was around 3 AM the temperature was 19
fahrenheit and I had taken multiple thaw out breaks including having
condensation on inner elements of the 30mm Wollensak eyepiece so I called it a
night.

Put threaded inserts (one went in crooked like always seems to

NGC4387 (next to/in M84), NGC4443 (small 11.2 mag near NGC4458), 
other 11-ish mag galaxies near Antennae
** Notes
Very small amount of urethane glue bubbled up around the edge of a
couple of the magnets. Doesn't seem to require corrective action.  Magnets
hold the fan to the 2 screws in bottom of the mirror box.  Set up telescope
around 11:30 PM waiting for moon to set around 1 AM.  Cooling mirror not
especially important since seeing is terrible (but good transparency after a
front came through). Took off azimuth encoder verified it turns easily
reattached it and securely tightened down the brass thumbscrew, but still
seemed to have azimuth errors of several degrees when moving the scope to a
new area.  Looked at Leo triplet M65, M66, and NGC3628 then to the other Leo
Messier objects, M95, M96, M105 plus the other 2 galaxies that fit in the
field with it M105; NGC3371 and NGC3373 (did not go hunting for several other
<= 11th magnitude galaxies nearby) then looked at NGC3190 and NGC3193 between
Al Gieba and Adhafera (did not notice 12th and 13th mag galaxies in/near
field).  Moved to Rho Viriginis to walk into Virgo cluster.  Observed NGC4608
and NGC4596 decided this wasn't a good starting place to get to the Siamese
Twins and moved up to M59, M60, and NGC4647 moved to M58 by way of NGC4606 and
NGC4607 then down to NGC4567 and NGC4568 (Siamese Twins) and NGC4564 (this is
incorrectly marked 4574 on Tami's charts which is a galaxy in Centaurus with
no apparent magnitude give on seds.org so probably faint) next bato to M58 on
the way to M89 detouring to M90 before proceeding to M87 and the Markian
Chain.  Definitely saw 8 possibly 9 galaxies in the field M84, M86, NGC4435,
NGC4438, NGC4425, NGC4407, NGC4388, and NGC4402 (I think I lost 4387 in M84).
Then walked up the chain NGC4461 and NGC4458 (I think I didn't notice 4443
which is small but 11.2 mag should look for it next time) continued to
NGC4473, NGC4479 and NGC4477 arriving at NGC4459 small bright (10.3 mag) and
next to a star (Kstars shows the star as not right next to 4459 possible epoch
error coords 12h30m29s +14d22m13s in kstars) finally over to NGC4474 and M88.
Did not look at the more farflung Coma-Virgo cluster members because I was
really cold.  Looked at M53, M51, and M101 then to southern objects. Looked at
NGC4361 nice 10.9 mag planetary, NGC4038 and NGC4039 (Antennae galaxies could
see they were odd but the antennae not visible, several other 11ish mag
galaxies nearby look for them next time).  Next M104 (Sombrero Galaxy) then
two new Messier objects M68 (Nice globular cluster) and M83 (Southern Pinwheel
Galaxy very nice 7.5 mag face on spiral galaxy, looked impressive viewed a
very low altitude through tree branches!)  Final object noticed bright star
not twinkling was probably Saturn (it was) looked at it in low power due to
craptacular seeing.

for a couple of things that had to be observed right after sunset (and may 
have been behind house or below the horizon like M2) plus poor
eastern and southeastern horizon and thin clouds that moved in before

Jason Weiseman finally made it over on a decent night.  Near first quarter moon
he arrived around 2230.  Initially some wispy clouds.  Observed moon and took
phone camera photos through eyepiece and looked at objects bright enough not to
be washed out (M22, M28, M13, M31).  After taking break and resuming around
midnight cleared up almost completely and observed east away from moon and
observed east until moonset then looked a few Sagittarius object not in murk.
M11 was Jason's favorite.  Looked at Veil with OIII filter. Great as usual. 
M27 was good, but Saturn Nebula (NGC7009) did not show much structure. Also
looked at Cat's Eye Nebula and didn't see much structure.  Bagged it a little
after 3.

NGC588, NGC604 (harder to pick out 604 than 3 SEP), NGC7293 (Helix Nebula),
Neptune (since it was in the neighborhood of the Helix)
** Notes
Transparency not great (better than a humid summer day but not as good as some
days last week and 2013-09-06 when I was too tired to go out). Looked at
M9, NGC6342, NGC6356, NGC6369, NGC6401, NGC6355, NGC6325 (bunch of globs and 
one planetary between Scorpius and Sagittarius mostly in Ophiuchus).  Noticed
Neptune near the Helix Nebula nicely positioned among 3 naked eye stars and
verify the star that looked bluish and less twinkly was in right spot.  Didn't 
quite see a disk at 300x.

** Notes
Good conditions partly cloudy afternoon was mostly clear at dark and completely
clear until nearly midnight when some thin wispy clouds started appearing. 
Clear to south and southeast so observed M4 and M80 for the last time this year
so alternated between low southern objects and M51, M101 etc. which were setting
 early in the evening.  Humid enough for a lot of dew (couple of drips from 
shroud onto mirror) and transparency wasn't awesome but was pretty good. 
Observed objects in Cepheus I was going to do when conditions crapped out last
time out. Lapdock for Raspberry Pi not fully charged (showed 4 of 5 power 
lights on front) and only got about 3 hours before down to one light and charge
light flashed red so shutdown after Uranus and the galaxy cluster (NGCs 193,
 194, 200, 198 and others) then finished up looking at Veil nebula including at
160x with Pretoria eyepiece and Ring and Dumbell nebulae then M45, M31 seeing 
more of arms with it higher above Culpeper light pollution and M33.  Clouds to
west and wispy scattered clouds were appearing as I put up scope.

** Notes
Observing after getting home from trip to Albuquerque.  On plane on return trip
rewrote ob_parse.py to count how many Herschel 400 objects observed based on 
NGC objects in observed field of obs.org.  Found only 58 had been observed so 
after starting off with M11, M57 and the Helix nebula, started observing 
Herschel 400 objects in Cygnus.  Clouds started to appear to south and east 
after 10 PM and completely crapped out while putting telescope away around 11
 PM.  New total is 65 Herschel 400 objects.

** Notes
Went out a little before midnight when the moon had finally set.  Did not get
telescope out to get the fan blowing on the mirror while waiting for moon to
set so poor thermal perfomance of mirror compounded poor seeing. Some hazy
clouds began to appear to south before 0200 by 0230 hazy stuff everywhere and
thicker to south so bagging it since cold and tired (temps near freezing).

seeing fair to poor able to just split inner double of epsilon lyrae then at

** Notes
amazingly cold 8 degrees with -10 to -20 wind chill despite about 4 hours on
fan mirror badly out of thermal equilibrium and heat shimmers apparent with
fuzzy balls for stars at 85x don't really know what seeing was like.  Wind
picked up after 35 minutes with gusts moving scope so put it up.  wasn't
watching where going and tripped on paver backing into shop no apparent damage
to me or scope. Pulled out Astroscan in lee of shop to test new eyepiece.
20mm university optics 70 degree afov looks good but 16 mm pretoria still
champ to see faint objects since used it for the maybe observations in Virgo

seeing and heat shimmer from mirror pprevented resolving e and f

** Notes
night often quite windy and seeing generally poor but occasionally the air
would steady also since ambient not far from mirror temp better viewing at low
power with 30mm explore scientific eyepiece than january observing.
Transparency ok between streaks of thin clouds/contrails clouds less
later. first chance after snow and full moon and last chance before neck
surgery to observe so went out for about an hour

After Cleardarksky.com forecast clouds and poor transparency until after
midnight plus winds for poor seeing decided not to go out tonight with big
scope. Went out for 10-15 minutes between 11:00 PM and 11:15 PM just to
quickly look with binoculars when it turned out to be clear apart from a few
clouds to the east and south

** Notes
got home near sunset.  After feeding cats set 20 inch dobsonian up with fan on
mirror and put astroscan on driveway to look at setting objects then waited
for dark with Loretta.  Seeing was fair to poor with mirror thermal effects
more significant than seeing.  Transparency and the number of wispy clouds got
worse after 1030

jupiter (2014-05-29-21:31 85x; 159x and new 15mm ep looked surprisingly good
with details of equatorial bands despite slight seeing shimmer), mars
(2014-05-29-21:45 85x; 159x; and with 15mm results very similar but may have
seen slightly more detail with 16mm pretoria than 15mm vixen ep), saturn

** Notes
Transparency fair with some hazy patches that worsened after 7 PM.  Seeing was
fair with 212x using 12mm eyepiece useable but not quite resolving all the
stars near the core of M13.  Took break around 8pm and conditions steadily
worsened put telescope away at 11:30 PM without any more observing

cold night more like February than March transparency good by the time the
 moon went down around 0345. Seeing fair to poor dominated by mirror thermal
 effects could just see cassini's division in saturn's rings,

overall poor transparency and seeing M1 at 22 degrees altitude not as easy to
resolve as usual (2015-04-18-22:14 51% RH 66.9F sensor may not be at

 was labelled ngc5317 but it appears correctly labeled when centered on
 ngc5364 with ctrl-f, (2015-05-24-01:30 79% RH 52.7F), seeing is fair to good
 based on saturn and epsilon lyrae, after some hazy clouds over 3/4 of sky

** Notes
keypad not working probable bad connections, 67.5 to 68 degrees altitude puts
the eyepiece at a good height for the third step of the 4 step ladder, 30
degrees altitude is a comfortable eyepiece height standing, 31 is a little
better slight hunching for 30 degrees, 32.5 degrees requires stretching up and
and 33 plus tiptoes

** Notes
transparency excellent after a cold front came through in the afternoon but
very windy and seeing is awful (2017-02-25-19:42 25% RH 52.7F) venus and mars
look like they are on the bottom of a swimming pool, transparency among the
best I've seen here observed horsehead nebula (2017-02-25-20:01 25% RH 51.3F),
mag 10 to 12 galaxies at 30 degrees altitude in the west are a little harder
to resolve than expected for the great transparency I suspect some of the
problem is the faint stars are fuzzy too (2017-02-25-20:22 30% RH 49.3F),
(2017-02-25-20:39 30% RH 49.1F), resuming after break (2017-02-25-22:10 31% RH

coincidence unplugging and replugging USB connectors did not fix had to pull
power jack and reboot (2017-02-25-22:58), (2017-02-25-23:13 36% RH 42.8F),
wind chill ferocious adding layers (2017-02-25-23:29 37% RH 41.7F), second
lockup not related to mount, (2017-02-26-00:10 37% RH 40.6F), thin clouds
driting in sporadically (2017-02-26-00:44 41% RH 39.4F), clouds over what I
want to look at in ursa major and coma berenices so quitting (2017-02-26-00:52

** Notes
seeing poor but significantly better than last night with no
wind. (2017-02-26-19:23 17% RH 47.5F), another system lockup around 1927,
(2017-02-26-19:33 24% RH 42.1F), only 4 stars resolvable in the trapezium but
that stars are not fuzzy discs like last night and the nebula does not look
like its at the bottom of a swimming pool, transparency excellent observed
horsehead nebula again (2017-02-26-19:44 30% RH 39.2F), after another lockup
spent forever setting up RPi 3 with Ubuntu Mate (the KDE setups put the config
files in different places and there still seem to be some things missing like
even through I copied the ngcic.dat from the odroid home directory the messier
globs don't have valid magnitudes, and of course there aere wispy clouds now
(2017-02-26-22:25 46% RH 35.8F), moost of the wisps hav drifted off

fairly good seeing 5 trapezium stars easily resolved some very thin hazy

(2018-03-18-21:17 48% RH 40.5F), going to move scope to walkway for better
